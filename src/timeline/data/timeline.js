      '"The year 1962 marked the beginning of a proliferation of computer-based permutation sequence generators.  In1962 Peck and Schrack presented algorithm PERMUTE, which inspired algorithm PERM by Trotter.  Although it was only 1962, Trotter noted that the excuse for adding PERM to the \'growing pile of permutation generators\' was that PERM offered an advantage in speed over previous algorithms...The Peck and Schrack and Trotter algorithms were quickly followed by a plethora of other algorithms to generate permutations or combinations, including algorithm PERMUTATION by Howell, PERMULEX by Schrack and Shimrat that produced permutatios in lexicographical order, PERMUTE by EAVES, COMBINATION by Kurtzberg, and an unnamed algorithm by Lotto, nearly all published in <strong>Communications of the ACM</strong> in 1962.  In addition, in 1962, Shen published a new method to generate permutations and combinations in lexicographical order that proved superior to a well-known method of generation by addition utilized by Howell in algorithm PERMUTATION." <br> Kenneth J.
