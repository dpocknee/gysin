# I AM THAT I AM
## Let The Mice In (1973)
### "The whole idea of the permutations came to me visually on seeing the so-called, Divine Tautology, in print. It looked wrong, to me, non symmetrical. The biggest word, That, belonged in the middle but all I had to do was to switch the last two words and It asked a question: ‘I Am That, Am I?’ The rest followed." —BG
